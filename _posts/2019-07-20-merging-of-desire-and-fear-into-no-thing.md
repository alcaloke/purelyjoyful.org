It is inevitable that both pleasurable and painful experiences are encountered in life. Also it is natural for us to desire pleasure, and fear pain. Desires and fears of all kinds occupy the human mind constantly, and they sustain a sense of self with unique characteristics and attributes. One could even say that, at the level of the mind; we are not anything other than a bundle of desires and fears, stored up as memories. 

Whenever we react to an experience, a particular memory is remembered and used to describe that experience as either this or that, good or bad, advantageous or disadvantageous, beautiful or ugly, and so on. This reminiscent function of the human mind is essential for the survival and the protection of the physical body; such as when there is a fire, we instinctively move away from it. 

> When we take our own reminiscent thoughts about the current experience as the reality; we are living in the past, instead of experiencing the present

However, most of the time our own memories get in the way of experiencing the actual reality. When we take our own reminiscent thoughts about the current experience as the reality; we are living in the past, instead of experiencing the present. The past memories in the mind are created by the desires and fears that arose during the initial experiences in which either pleasure or pain was registered by the mind. 

> The illusion of the separate self *is* the movement of thoughts that exhibit themselves as your desires and fears

Essentially, most of our lives are lived through a veil of desires and fears that shape the experience to be what it is not. To be even more direct, the separate individual that we think we are, is nothing more than those collection of desires and fears. In other words, the illusion of the separate self *is* the movement of thoughts that exhibit themselves as your desires and fears.

> If we are able to see through that most of our thoughts and actions are a response of our memories; which are a kind of involuntary reaction to our own deeply held desires and fears; we can establish a new and liberating relationship to all of our thoughts and actions that arise out of our experiences

If we are able to see through that most of our thoughts and actions are a response of our memories; which are a kind of involuntary reaction to our own deeply held desires and fears; we can establish a new and liberating relationship to all of our thoughts and actions that arise out of our experiences. 

> With the constant recognition that our desires and fears are nothing more than a kind of biomechanical response of the brain; our automated reaction of attaching to desire, and resisting fear may begin to gradually dissipate

First of all, we cannot deny that the mind will continue to respond to pleasurable experiences as desirable, and painful experiences as fearful; it is simply how the brain is structured to respond. However, with the constant recognition that our desires and fears are nothing more than a kind of biomechanical response of the brain; our automated reaction of attaching to desire, and resisting fear may begin to gradually dissipate.

> Without the power of: 1. desire to pull us into pleasure, and, 2. fear to push us away from pain; they become nothing more than *a movement of thought*. It is possible that desire and fear merge into a kind of *no-thing*; just a creative expression of the mind, that is empty in essence

Without the power of: 1. desire to pull us into pleasure, and, 2. fear to push us away from pain; they become nothing more than *a movement of thought*. It is possible that desire and fear merge into a kind of *no-thing*; just a creative expression of the mind, that is empty in essence. 

> The power and the distinguishable nature of thought originates from the absolute belief we have about them. Without this absolute belief, a thought is something that simply arises and falls away

You may begin to see that a thought is nothing more than a fluctuation of mental energy. Whether it is desirable, fearful, pleasurable or painful; in essence, they are actually indistinguishable from each other. The power and the distinguishable nature of thought originates from the absolute belief we have about them. Without this absolute belief, a thought is something that simply arises and falls away; just like all experiences and all phenomena; i.e. the condensation and evaporation of clouds; the birth and death of a person; the beginning and ending of a civilisation; drinking a cup of coffee; meeting a friend; going for a walk; looking out of the window, and so on. 

> Without denying the relative characteristics of experiences defined by the mind; your heart may always be firmly grounded in the absolute reality; which is eternally empty, silent and still

We will continue to succeed, make mistakes, encounter fortunate and unfortunate circumstances, however, we can live our lives without being *held* by any of it. When a thought arises to define *this* as desirable, and *that* as fearful; the recognition that all thoughts are nothing more than a movement of energy, and that they are empty in essence; allows us to experience everything as *is*. Without denying the relative characteristics of experiences defined by the mind; your heart may always be firmly grounded in the absolute reality; which is eternally empty, silent and still.
