Everything that we experience in life; whether it is pleasurable or painful; is a manifestation of love. What is this love that expresses itself as everything that we experience? Love is totally unbiased and unconditional allowance of everything as it is. 

> Your love for the other, is dependent on a particular quality that they can provide for you. If that quality was to one day disappear, you will no longer love them. Is that genuine love? 

The word love has become distorted as a result of being overused in our modern culture. Most of us do not know what love actually means. When you think that you love someone; a family member, a partner, a friend or even yourself; what does it actually mean? Do you think about *what* it is that you love about them? Is it even possible to point out an objective quality that you can confidently define as something that you love about them? If that is the case, it means that your love for the other, is dependent on a particular quality that they can provide for you. If that quality was to one day disappear, you will no longer love them. Is that genuine love? 

> True love has nothing to do with being dependent on what the other person or something has to give 

True love has nothing to do with being dependent on what the other person or something has to give. Also love is not exclusive to human beings. Love exists in everything and everywhere; in animals, rocks, plants, trees, buildings, cities, the sky, the ocean, the space, and in every experiences of all living beings, as well as, in every inanimate objects. 

> Everything is a manifestation of love, and love is unconditional allowance of everything as is 

Love is existence itself; this mystifying and miraculous reality that we call the world, and all the things within. Just observe the myriads of different species of animals, vegetation, landscapes, cultures, lives and so on. Is it not amazing that reality has allowed such diversity of existences? The crucial point is that reality has allowed all *this*, without any judgement nor conditions. Everything is allowed to flourish on in its own accord, with its own unique colours and characteristics. Everything is a manifestation of love, and love is unconditional allowance of everything as is.

> Love allows all kinds of existences and experiences to manifest because it is absolutely unconditional. To love, even cruelty and destruction have their own place. Love does not judge them as unfit for manifestation

You may challenge; if everything is a manifestation of love, how is it that our lives are full of fear and pain? How can we explain all the suffering in the world? Such questions arise out of misunderstanding what love is. Love is not only kind, caring and creative. Love can also be cruel, indifferent and destructive. Love allows all kinds of existences and experiences to manifest because it is absolutely unconditional. To love, even cruelty and destruction have their own place. Love does not judge them as unfit for manifestation.

> With the understanding that whatever life brings is an expression of love; you may begin to equalise pleasure, pain, fear, hope, and all other experiences as indistinguishable from each other; as not anything other than love loving itself! 

By recognising love for what it is; unconditional allowance of everything as is; you may live a life that is fearless of fear, and hopeless of hope. Life is constantly in flux to bring about all kinds of pleasurable and painful experiences. With the understanding that whatever life brings is an expression of love; you may begin to equalise pleasure, pain, fear, hope, and all other experiences as indistinguishable from each other; as not anything other than love loving itself! We are all love loving itself; each of us manifesting as an authentic individual with an unique journey consisting of both the light and the dark.

> We can find comfort and assurance in the fact that there is not a single moment when we are not embraced by love. Love is existence itself, where everything is constantly unfolding out of the that unconditional allowance

There is no denying that life will bring fear, pain and all kinds of unfortunate circumstances, but we can find comfort and assurance in the fact that there is not a single moment when we are not embraced by love. Love is existence itself, where everything is constantly unfolding out of the that unconditional allowance. We cannot get away from that embrace of love however hard we try, because our existence and every experience within, is love loving itself.
