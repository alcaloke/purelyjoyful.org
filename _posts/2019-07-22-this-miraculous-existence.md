Everything that arises in our experience, falls away as soon as it appears. Whether that be a thought, a feeling, a sensation, or an intuition; an experience is always one of a kind, and more importantly, eternally *continuous*. 

It is impossible to stop or interrupt an experience at an intrinsic level. Of course, you can cease to perform a particular action but that experience is still continuous in the sense that; you cannot cease that performance, without having begun it in the first place. You can stop reading this sentence right now, but it is only because you have started it, that you can stop reading it.

Have you ever watched a movie on a DVD player, where due to an error in the disc, the picture suddenly freezed, or skipped forward or backward in time? Obviously, this can never happen in reality. Why am I pointing out this plain fact that an experience is always continuous? Because, this continuous nature of reality is immensely overlooked.

> A thought can only be defined in discrete terms. Therefore, a thought is always a limited, and, an abstracted description of what *is*. Something abstract is immaculate or flawless in how it presents itself

We overlook at the fact that our experiences are always continuous because we can only approach to understand them with our thoughts. A thought can only be defined in discrete terms. Therefore, a thought is always a limited, and, an abstracted description of what *is*. Something abstract is immaculate or flawless in how it presents itself. 

As an example; close your eyes, and think of a purely *green* colour. How flawless is that image of the colour green in your mind? Close your eyes again, and think about what you desire most right now. How immaculately defined and specific are those desires?

> Life is far from discrete and immaculate; it is quite the opposite actually. Life is absolutely continuous and raw!

The mind can only attempt at understanding life, by imagining in discrete terms, and immaculate forms. However, life is far from discrete and immaculate; it is quite the opposite actually. Life is absolutely continuous and raw! 

> The human mind is constantly in conflict because we try to comprehend and control life through our thoughts; where the conflict is not anything other than the mind struggling to make any sense of the actual reality. How can that which operates in discrete and immaculate forms, comprehend that which is inherently continuous and raw?

The human mind is constantly in conflict because we try to comprehend and control life through our thoughts; where the conflict is not anything other than the mind struggling to make any sense of the actual reality. How can that which operates in discrete and immaculate forms, comprehend that which is inherently continuous and raw?

If you are able to recognise this obvious fact, that all experiences are eternally continuous, and that you can never truly comprehend or control life through your thoughts; life becomes totally simple and orderly.

> At a relative level, life is complicated and chaotic, but at a closer examination; you may notice that it is your mind that is complicated and chaotic rather than your life

At a relative level, life is complicated and chaotic, but at a closer examination; you may notice that it is your mind that is complicated and chaotic rather than your life. Of course, the mind is chaotic! It is incessantly trying to acquire that which it cannot even get close to. How the mind operates is totally incompatible with how the reality operates. Trying to comprehend life, is like trying to breathe rocks; utterly and hopelessly futile.  

> When you cease all of your futile efforts to comprehend or control life in anyway whatsoever; life presents itself as the only way it can: a miraculous continuity!

When you cease all of your futile efforts to comprehend or control life in anyway whatsoever; life presents itself as the only way it can: a miraculous continuity! What was chaotic and complicated before, becomes orderly and simple, because there is nothing to comprehend nor control anymore. To be absolutely precise; it is beyond order and simplicity, since the dualistic approach of experiencing life is totally given up.

> It may even seem natural, that you fear about something that is indeed fearful; which serves as an evidence that life is functioning as it should. More to the point, how mystifying and wondrous that life should exist and function at all!

This does not mean that our lives will always be filled with unicorns and rainbows. Life continues as before. Fear, doubt and pain will continue to arise, but even such negative emotions are experienced to be miraculous! Since, you no longer try to comprehend nor control them; you can only marvel at the fact of their existence. How amazing is it that you can actually fear, doubt or feel pain? It may even seem natural, that you fear about something that is indeed fearful; which serves as an evidence that life is functioning as it should. More to the point; how mystifying and wondrous that life should exist and function at all!
