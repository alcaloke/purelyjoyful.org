As much as we would like to think that we are in control of our lives; all circumstances manifest autonomously. Also it is only the absolute belief in our own thoughts, that create the illusion of a freely determined, and a characteristic reality. Most of these thoughts are not anything other than desires and fears that strive to make up for an unfathomable sense of lack; deeply embedded within each of our psyche.

> Ultimately, all problems of our lives boil down to how we think about ourselves. How we think, determines the world that we live in

Ultimately, all problems of our lives boil down to how we think about ourselves. How we think, determines the world that we live in.

> Just like everything else in life, we cannot control how, what and when we think

To be more precise, thoughts are not the problem in themselves. Just like everything else in life, we cannot control how, what and when we think. All thoughts arise autonomously, and it is impossible to know where they come from nor where they go.

> Thoughts become problematic, only because we allow them to be. In a way, we allow thoughts to trample all over us unnecessarily

Thoughts become problematic, only because we allow them to be. In a way, we allow thoughts to trample all over us unnecessarily. Why do we do this? Because we think that we create our own thoughts, and, believe in their contents absolutely.

> Thoughts are not the problem in themselves. It is how we relate to them, that entitles a thought with power to wield us

It is possible to re-establish the relationship to our own thinking, so that we do not allow _any_ thoughts to become problematic. To repeat again; thoughts are not the problem in themselves. It is how we relate to them that, entitles a thought with power to wield us.

> How do we change our relationship to thinking? By recognising that all thoughts arise autonomously and that their contents are insignificant at an absolute level

How do we change our relationship to thinking? By recognising that all thoughts arise autonomously and that their contents are insignificant at an absolute level.

How do I know that all thoughts arise autonomously? Because it is impossible to stop thinking at will. Of course, it seems possible to think about a specific subject or object at will. However, it cannot be proven that, the specific thought is freely chosen by the self. The only proof that can determine whether a thought is freely chosen or not, is if you are able to stop thinking at will; which is impossible.

On the other hand, there are ample evidences for supporting the case that thoughts arise autonomously. The mind is constantly refreshed with all kinds of thoughts; unexpected, predictable, fearful, pleasurable, emotional, envious, logical, irrational, hysterical, and so on.

> Surely, if we were truly free to choose our own thoughts, we would only have pleasurable, blissful and other desirable thoughts at all times. Instead, the opposite seems to be the case

Surely, if we were truly free to choose our own thoughts, we would only have pleasurable, blissful and other desirable thoughts at all times. Instead, the opposite seems to be the case. We are haunted by anxious, painful and other undesirable thoughts most of the time. It is obvious that such thoughts arise against our will; as is the case for all other thoughts.

A painful thought is only problematic if we think that we can do something about it; for example to stop it, or to change it somehow. When it is accepted that we cannot do anything about a painful thought because it arises autonomously; it no longer carries the power to be problematic. While still acknowledging the relative effect that is its painfulness; we cease to expand that thought into imagined problems of all kinds, which is totally unnecessary.

> Whether you are envious, proud or anxious, if you can recognise the fact that absolutely nothing can be done about it, then that thought is spontaneously liberated right there and then

The above logic applies to all thoughts. Whether you are envious, proud or anxious, if you can recognise the fact that absolutely nothing can be done about it, then that thought is spontaneously liberated right there and then.

Whether we recognise it or not, all thoughts are spontaneously liberated as soon as they arise. The relative effect that a thought carries is only valid for the moment it arises. It is easy to see this when we are passionately immersed in a personally cherished activity; such as writing, reading, listening to music, playing sports or whatever it may be. During the immersion, a worry that would normally occupy the mind, is nowhere to be seen.

> If anxiety was real, then how is it possible that there are moments in the day when we are totally free from anxiety?

The effect that a thought carries is insubstantial. If it was substantial, how is it possible that the effect of a thought can come in and out of existence? If anxiety was real, then how is it possible that there are moments in the day when we are totally free from anxiety?

With the recognition that we do not choose our own thoughts, and, the effect that a thought carries is insubstantial; we can begin to establish a new relationship to our thinking mind; that which is free from unnecessary fixations.

> It is ok that we have anxious, fearful, lustful and other undesirable thoughts. It is normal to have all kinds of thoughts, because we do not choose them at all

It is ok that we have anxious, fearful, lustful and other undesirable thoughts. It is normal to have all kinds of thoughts, because we do not choose them at all. Also the relative effect that each thought carries, such as good or bad; beautiful or ugly, and so on; lose their meaning with the disappearance of that thought. At an absolute level, there is no meaning whatsoever to anything.

When we clearly see that all thoughts that arise are spontaneously liberated; every moment that we experience is totally new. There is never a recycled moment. The appearance of the old, the mundane and the fearful are only illusions created by our memories.

> Realise the incontrollable and insignificant nature of all thoughts, and experience reality for what it truly is; always fresh and new

Realise the incontrollable and insignificant nature of all thoughts, and experience reality for what it truly is; always fresh and new.
