There are two ways in which most people love themselves. One way is by idealising yourself to be someone that you are not. Whether that idealisation has to do with a picture perfect image of your physical self, or imagining yourself to be super talented at whatever that you are working on; such idealised image of yourself is most likely to be an over-estimated and a distorted version of who you actually are. 

The second way of loving yourself is by comparing yourself to others, where the personal attributes that you are particularly fond of, are emphasised in direct comparison to other people’s attributes, where you may feel relatively superior as a result. It could be highlighting the fact you are professionally more successful than most of your friends, or that you are more intellectually gifted than others and so on.

Such ways of loving ourselves are not genuine and cannot be sustained. In idealisation, we are not being true to ourselves, where we indulge in delusional thinking, as we cannot accept ourselves as who we actually are. In comparing ourselves to others to feel superior, not only is it an unkind way to relate with others, but a relatively defined attribute is always subject to change. There will always be someone who is more successful, beautiful or intelligent than you are.

> What is considered as *good* is actually indistinguishable from what is considered as *bad*

To genuinely love yourself without self-delusion or comparison to others; you must know yourself. What does it even mean to know yourself? Human beings are paradoxical creatures. None of us can be clearly defined as either this or that, especially when it comes to how our characteristics are exhibited. It is natural for the mind to define constructive characteristics such as beauty, intelligence and courage as *good*, while to define destructive characteristics such as ugliness, laziness and cowardliness as *bad*. However, none of our characteristics can be defined as such, because they are not an individual phenomenon with clearly set boundaries. What is considered as *good* is actually indistinguishable from what is considered as *bad*.


> What is considered beautiful can become ugly when it is indulged excessively. Also what is considered ugly can become beautiful when it presents itself with purity and fearlessness

The reason why we either idealise, or compare ourselves to others is because we are attached to fixed definitions of our own characteristics. As an example, if you absolutely believe in your physical beauty as a fixed attribute, you are just chasing a mental image in your mind. Instead, you could be appreciating your authentic beauty; which is much more of a fluid way of being. Beauty is a subjective matter. It is also beyond skin deep. What is considered beautiful can become ugly when it is indulged excessively. Also what is considered ugly can become beautiful when it presents itself with purity and fearlessness.

> To know yourself, the whole spectrum of your being must be acknowledged. It means accepting that both the light and the dark sides make up the being that you are, or, that they are actually one and the same

To know yourself, the whole spectrum of your being must be acknowledged. It means accepting that both the light and the dark sides make up the being that you are, or, that they are actually one and the same. The attributes that you cherish about yourself are no different to the attributes that you feel shameful about. The light cannot exist without the dark. As an example, someone who is rationally gifted will be less sensitive to the matters of feeling and emotion. An extrovert is likely to have more friends and a livelier life than an introvert, but may suffer from superficial relationships, and a restless desire to fill her time with all kinds of activities. An introvert is likely to have fewer but deeper relationships and a rich inner world, but may suffer from loneliness and less contact with reality. 

> The problem arises when we cannot see that our strengths and weaknesses are the result of each other

The problem arises when we cannot see that our strengths and weaknesses are the result of each other. An extrovert’s livelier life is the result of her restlessness. The source of a rationally gifted mind is his lack of sensitivity towards feeling and emotion. An introvert’s rich inner world is the product of his solitude and so on. Self-idealisation and comparing ourselves to others are the ways in which our strengths and weaknesses are seen as fixed attributes, and used for affirming our sense of being as either superior, or as a counteraction to make up for feeling inferior.

> Knowing that your strength arises from your weakness, and all of your characteristics are fluid rather than fixed, you no longer depend on fixed attributes to affirm a sense of self that feels superior against others

To genuinely love yourself without idealisation or comparison to others; know that your strengths and weaknesses are actually one and the same, and that you should equally embrace both the light and the dark sides of your personality as one cannot exist without the other. Knowing that your strength arises from your weakness, and all of your characteristics are fluid rather than fixed, you no longer depend on fixed attributes to affirm a sense of self that feels superior against others. 

> Genuinely loving yourself is based on appreciating your authenticity; that you are the only person in the world with unique strengths and weaknesses, both of which make up the one and only, special person that you are

Instead, you may begin to feel confident regardless of what you think yourself to be. Go beyond defining yourself as powerful or weak; good or evil; beautiful or ugly and so on because such definitions are ultimately unnecessary. Then, a self-love arises autonomously from appreciating the whole spectrum of yourself. Such self-love is not dependent on idealised version of what you think you are, or want to be, nor thinking that you are better than others. Genuinely loving yourself is based on appreciating your authenticity; that you are the only person in the world with unique strengths and weaknesses, both of which make up the one and only; special person that you are.
