All that happens in our lives, does not matter at all. Our experiences and circumstances have no intrinsic value whatsoever, because they are only an appearance. Of course, all appearances have their own unique characteristics but the essence of all appearances are the same: incomprehensible.

> We can describe how things are, but we can never actually explain them

We can describe how things are, but we can never actually explain them. As an example, the Big Bang theory describes how the universe came to be; the expansion from a very high-density and high-temperature state. However, the theory does not explain what the universe is and why it came to be.

> Try to explain what you are to yourself right now. You are not your name, brain, past, habits nor any of the things that can be described about you

We can never explain what anything is nor why it exists; including ourselves. Try to explain what you are to yourself right now. You are not your name, brain, past, habits nor any of the things that can be described about you. Likewise, it is impossible to explain how your existence is being sustained right now, and for what purpose.

> All that we can do is marvel at the fact of our existence; the basis of which is totally incomprehensible to the human mind

All that we can do is marvel at the fact of our existence; the basis of which is totally incomprehensible to the human mind. The experiencing of our experiences is the most mysterious wonder; that we can think, see, hear, feel, taste and smell at all is a miracle.

> To give any phenomena a tangible or permanent quality is impossible; so how can we regard anything as real?

Everything is an appearance because we can never explain anything about its existence. To give any phenomena a tangible or permanent quality is impossible; so how can we regard anything as real? Our experiences and circumstances are simply appearing out of the most mysterious no-thingness; that which we can never understand with our logic.

> The mind confuses labelling things with knowing things. Just because we have names and descriptions for everything, that does not mean that we know it!

When we can accept the incomprehensibility and mysteriousness of life, it ceases to be mundane and full of suffering. Life seems mundane only because we take everything for granted; as if we know everything about everything. The mind confuses labelling things with knowing things. Just because we have names and descriptions for everything, that does not mean that we know it! A mind that is certain about everything, lives a life that is monotonous and uninspiring, because everything is old and made up entirely of second-hand interpretations.

> Fear is no longer fearful when it is seen with the light of reverence for the mysteriousness of life

Instead, if we can accept the fact that we do not truly know anything, and that our so-called knowledge is merely a depiction of things; life becomes immensely inspiring, and free from suffering. A mind that does not take anything for granted is continuously alert; where each passing moment is totally anew. Even fear is experienced to be something that arises out of the background of utter curiosity and wonder. Fear is no longer fearful when it is seen with the light of reverence for the mysteriousness of life.

> All experiences begin to share a common ground: the astonishment at the fact that experiencing of an experience is possible at all

Living a life without certainties does not mean that experiences lose their characteristics. Pleasure is still pleasurable, and, pain is still painful. But they are taken to be appearances with no intrinsic value at all. Instead, all experiences begin to share a common ground: the astonishment at the fact that experiencing of an experience is possible at all.

> When you no longer try to understand the polarity of life, ultimately everything equalises to be indistinguishable from each other. All that remains is silence and stillness of the most profound kind

To live like this to go beyond the polarity of experiences, without denying their characteristics. You still find something to be beautiful and something else to be ugly. However, it is impossible to know why such polarity exists at all. When you no longer try to understand the polarity of life, ultimately everything equalises to be indistinguishable from each other. All that remains is silence and stillness of the most profound kind.
