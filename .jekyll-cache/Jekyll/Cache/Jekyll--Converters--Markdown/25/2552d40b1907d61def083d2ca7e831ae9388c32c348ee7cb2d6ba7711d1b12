<p>The only thing in life that does not change, is change itself. This paradoxical and ironic truth reveals profound insights about how to live oneâ€™s life. As discussed in the <a href="/blog/emptiness-speaks-through-transience-of-life">last post</a>, there is nothing that one can sustain in oneâ€™s experiences. How can we sustain anything when everything is constantly changing? However, the fact that change is the only changeless quality in life is refreshingly liberating. It means that we can let go of whatever that life brings as soon as it is experienced. Whether you are fearful, hopeful, depressed, or happy; the only certainty you can have about the experience is that it wonâ€™t last. This is how it is already; you simply have to recognise it, and your life will always be filled with child-like wonder and curiosity!</p>

<p>It is inevitable that relatively unfortunate circumstances will arise, along with fears and doubts of all kinds, but when you know with absolute certainty that these experiences wonâ€™t last; they no longer have any power to make you suffer. You cease to <em>resist</em> fear and misfortunes because they are realised to be part of the ongoing process of change in life, and, for that same reason, you cease to <em>attach</em> to hope and fortunes. You may begin to see that hope is the source of your fear, or even that they are one and the same! As soon as you hope for something better, you create the fear of not getting it. Without any resistance or attachment to whatever that life throws at you, your life becomes purely joyful, which is a kind of amazing wonder at the fact of our miraculous existence.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the beginning it might be difficult to let go of your attachment to hope and resistance to fear. We have spent most of our lives stuck in a perpetual loop of hoping and fearing. In order to break the cycle, we must destroy the belief that we can make anything permanent in our experiences; whether that be a personal identity, happiness, affluence, security and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hope is the desire to make something permanent in oneâ€™s life, and fear is what we experience when that desire for permanence is crushed by the only way that life operates; impermanence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something true must be changeless because how else could it prove its own truth? The only truth or changeless quality in life is that everything is constantly changing. Hope is the desire to make something permanent in oneâ€™s life, and fear is what we experience when that desire for permanence is crushed by the only way that life operates; impermanence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without dissecting life into all kinds of better or worse; it constantly shines with myriads of perceptions that spring from infinite possibilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such understanding will allow us to live beyond hope and fear, where life simply becomes what it is. One no longer labels something as good nor evil, beautiful nor ugly, high nor low and so on. The only truth of life <em>is</em> change and in that changeless truth, one finds that life is simply miraculously beautiful and a source of immense inspiration. Without dissecting life into all kinds of better or worse; it constantly shines with myriads of perceptions that spring from infinite possibilities.</p>
