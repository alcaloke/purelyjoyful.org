I"Ö<p>Be indifferent to the characteristics of all experiences and circumstances in your life. By indifference, I do not mean that you should not care about anything nor take things for granted, but see through the fact that the characteristics of all experiences and circumstances have no intrinsic value at all. Everything is an illusion that constantly reshapes itself. Be indifferent to the illusion of all life situations, however terrifying or blissful they are.</p>
