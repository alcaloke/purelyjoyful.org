I"þ<p>Be indifferent to the characteristics of all experiences and circumstances in your life. By indifference, I do not mean that you should not care about anything nor take things for granted, but see through the fact that the characteristics of all experiences and circumstances have no intrinsic value at all. Everything is an illusion that constantly reshapes itself. Be indifferent to the illusion of all life situations, however terrifying or blissful they are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We cannot understand the illusion of reality because our own perspective <em>is</em> the illusion; just like we cannot see ourselves directly because the eyes can only observe outwardly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not try to understand the illusion of reality with the mind. By default, the mind can only measure and define from its own perspective. We cannot understand the illusion of reality because our own perspective <em>is</em> the illusion; just like we cannot see ourselves directly because the eyes can only observe outwardly.</p>

<p>All that we can do is to confirm the illusion of reality, or, the illusion of our own perspective. We can confirm it by the fact that nothing can be made permanent in our experience. The only certainty that we can have about our own perspective is that it is constantly changing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no denying that there is a reality to the perspective, but we cannot prove that the perspective itself is not an illusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One may pick up an object like a scissors and state that it is real, where its reality can be proven by the sensation of its solidity and sharpness. There is no denying that there is a reality to the perspective, but we cannot prove that the perspective itself is not an illusion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without the names that we have given to our so-called objects and subjects, reality simply <em>is</em>; an oneness of infinite potential in constant fluctuation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the characteristics that we believe to be true are merely descriptions that the mind has designated. Without the names that we have given to our so-called objects and subjects, reality simply <em>is</em>; an oneness of infinite potential in constant fluctuation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ultimately, there is nothing that can be explained about reality. All that we can do is to acknowledge the fact of its fluid existence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no substantiality to any names or descriptions. Words gain and lose their meanings as history unfolds and some languages are completely forgotten. Ultimately, there is nothing that can be explained about reality. All that we can do is to acknowledge the fact of its fluid existence.</p>

<p>Accepting the fluidity and undefinable nature of reality, allow us to be indifferent to its relative characteristics. It does not mean that we wonâ€™t care nor become violent. Rather, it is likely that we will become more gentle, kind and loving as we are no longer swayed by fears and desires of all kinds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being relentlessly convinced by the characteristics of all experiences is a gruelling task; where we incessantly desire pleasure and fear pain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being relentlessly convinced by the characteristics of all experiences is a gruelling task; where we incessantly desire pleasure and fear pain. Such life is nothing more than a continual retaliation against what <em>is</em>, and it can only lead to violence.</p>

<p>Welcome all experiences and circumstances, but be indifferent to their relative characteristics without denying them. Otherwise, we will be stuck in a cycle of life that comprises only of desire and fear. Whether we know it or not, most of us live like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The indifference that I am discussing here is not a nihilistic nor detached attitude. It a kind of wondrous approach to life, since by being indifferent to the characteristics of all experiences allow us to actually <em>act</em> with life rather than <em>react</em> to life</p>

<p>The indifference that I am discussing here is not a nihilistic nor detached attitude. It a kind of wondrous approach to life, since by being indifferent to the characteristics of all experiences allow us to actually <em>act</em> with life rather than <em>react</em> to life.</p>

<p>In reaction, we are constantly fighting against life. In action, we are life itself; where all dualistic boundaries that the mind had setup dissolves. No longer are we attracted nor repelled; hopeful nor fearful about anything. Then, life begins to flow effortlessly regardless of its inevitable complexities where every moment is an open field of infinite potential.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fear of aging, loneliness, disease, self-contempt, doubt and so on; lose their power to make us suffer if we can see through their intrinsically void nature. It is only when we take them seriously that such thoughts and emotions begin to rule us. Know that it is in our own power to be indifferent to them, which allows us to abide in that pure, space-less space of eternal joyfulness</p>

<p>A graceful life can be lived without contradicting the painful aspects of being a human. The fear of aging, loneliness, disease, self-contempt, doubt and so on; lose their power to make us suffer if we can see through their intrinsically void nature. It is only when we take them seriously that such thoughts and emotions begin to rule us. Know that it is in our own power to be indifferent to them, which allows us to abide in that pure, space-less space of eternal joyfulness.</p>
