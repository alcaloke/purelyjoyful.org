</blockquote>

<p>Life is not as dramatic as one thinks it to be. It is only thoughts that label all kinds of experiences as either this or that; beautiful or ugly; fortunate or unfortunate; pleasurable or painful and so on. If one is able to see beyond such superficial appearances of life that are defined by thoughts; life becomes spontaneously silent and still. There is no denying that forms are seen, sounds are heard, concepts are thought and so on, but all such perceptions are empty in essence. Actually the only certainty we can have about life is that everything arises out of emptiness, and that emptiness speaks to us through transience of life.</p>

  <p>Have you ever noticed that it is impossible to sustain anything in our experience?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, it is very difficult to see that everything is emptiness. We clearly perceive things with our senses, which bring about all kinds of thoughts and feelings. How can these seemingly tangible things that I perceive and experience, be empty in essence? However, have you ever noticed that it is impossible to sustain anything in our experience? Whether it be a thought, a sound, a feeling, an emotion, a memory, a phone call, a conversation, a celebration, and so on; one can never hold onto an experience even for a moment! Every experience is constantly moving and changing. Of course, it is possible to have similar experiences, however, they are never quite the same as the ones that came before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only something that is illusory can come in and out of existence because only its insubstantial nature allows it to change from a thing to no-thing, and visa-versa</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live our lives believing that our world is absolutely real. But how can that which is real, be so fleeting? Surely, if something is real, one should be able to experience it again and again with absolute consistency. Also something real must be changeless because it can only prove its own reality by being not anything other than what it is. If something is subject to change, that very change destroys the reference points for proving its own authenticity. A human being exists temporarily by borrowing some matter from Earth, then ceases to exist by returning that matter to Earth. If we are truly real, how is it that we can cease to exist? Only something that is illusory can come in and out of existence because only its insubstantial nature allows it to change from a thing to no-thing, and visa-versa.</p>

<p>The recognition that all that we experience in life are empty in essence allows us to be firmly grounded against the apparent drama of life. Without denying the inevitable pain, as well as the pleasure that life brings, it is possible to simply flow with all that one experiences, whatever its flavour. The subtlety is in noticing that it is impossible to hold onto any aspects of our experiences. There is nothing that we can make permanent regardless of how hard we try.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is transience; and its fleetingness is the language in which emptiness speaks to us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Life is transience; and its fleetingness is the language in which emptiness speaks to us. Try right now to make anything in your experience to be permanent. Can you hold on to a same thought for more than a couple of seconds? Look out of your window. Is it possible to hold that view, and will you see exactly that same view ever again; with the same patterns of clouds, shades of lights reflecting on the buildings, and the unique growth of surrounding vegetation etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact that we cannot hold onto anything is actually a hidden blessing. It implies that we are inherently boundless and free</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ever changing life does not allow us to hold onto anything but out of the apparent drama of life, we may find that life is pulling a big joke on us. The fact that we cannot hold onto anything is actually a hidden blessing. It implies that we are inherently boundless and free. The transience of life renders each passing moment to be always fresh. Paradoxically that constant freshness of life has silent and still qualities. It is emptiness speaking to each and every one of us to let go and be joyful.</p>
