I"W<p>Ultimately, all problems of our lives boil down to <em>“how we think”</em>, which shapes the world that we live in. To be more precise, thoughts are not the problem in themselves, because we cannot control what and when we think. All thoughts arise autonomously, and it is impossible to know where they come from nor where they go.</p>
