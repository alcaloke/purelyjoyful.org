I"<p>Ultimately, all problems of our lives boil down to <em>“how we think”</em>, which shapes the world that we live in. To be more precise, thoughts are not the problem in themselves, because we cannot control what and when we think. All thoughts arise autonomously, and it is impossible to know where they come from nor where they go.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thoughts become problematic, only because we allow them. Why do we do this? Because we think that we create our own thoughts, and, believe in their contents absolutely</p>

<p>It is possible to establish a new relationship to our own thoughts, so that we do not allow <em>any</em> of them to become problematic. To repeat again; thoughts are not the problem in themselves. It is how we relate to them that entitles a thought with the power to tyrannise us.</p>

  <p>How do we change the relationship to our own thoughts? By recognising that all thoughts arise autonomously and that their contents are insignificant at an absolute level</p>

<p>How do we change the relationship to our own thoughts? By recognising that all thoughts arise autonomously and that their contents are insignificant at an absolute level.</p>

<p>How do I know that all thoughts arise autonomously? Because it is impossible to stop thinking at will. Of course, it seems possible to think about a specific subject or object at will. However, it cannot be proven that a specific thought is freely chosen by ourselves. The only proof that can determine whether a thought is freely chosen or not is if we are able to stop our thinking at will; which is impossible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are ample evidences for supporting the case that thoughts arise autonomously. The mind is constantly refreshed with all kinds of thoughts; unexpected, predictable, fearful, pleasurable, envious, logical, irrational, hysterical, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surely, if we were truly free to choose our own thoughts, we would only have pleasurable and blissful thoughts at all times. Instead, the opposite seems to be the case</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely, if we were truly free to choose our own thoughts, we would only have pleasurable and blissful thoughts at all times. Instead, the opposite seems to be the case. We are haunted by anxious and painful thoughts most of the time. It is obvious that such thoughts arise against our will; as is the case for all other types of thoughts.</p>

<p>A painful thought is only problematic if we think that we can do something about it; for example, to stop it or to change it somehow. When it is accepted that we cannot do anything about a painful thought because it arises autonomously; it no longer carries the power to be problematic. While still acknowledging the relative effect that is its painfulness; we may cease to amplify that thought by imagining further problems of all kinds, which is totally unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you are envious or anxious, if you can recognise the fact that absolutely nothing can be done about it, then that thought is spontaneously liberated right there and then</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above logic applies to all thoughts. Whether you are anxious or envious, if you can recognise the fact that absolutely nothing can be done about it, then that thought is spontaneously liberated right there and then.</p>

<p>Whether we recognise it or not, all thoughts are spontaneously liberated as soon as they arise. The relative effect that a thought carries is only valid for the moment it arises. It is easy to see this when immersed in an activity that we are passionate about; such as working, reading, listening to music, playing sports or whatever it may be. During the immersion, a worry that would normally occupy the mind, is nowhere to be experienced.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If anxiety was real, then how is it possible that there are moments in the day when we are totally free from anxiety?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The effect that a thought carries is insubstantial. If it was substantial, how is it possible that the effect of a thought can come in and out of existence? If anxiety was real, then how is it possible that there are moments in the day when we are totally free from anxiety?</p>

<p>With the recognition that we do not choose our own thoughts, and, the effect that a thought carries is insubstantial; we can begin to establish a new relationship to our own thoughts; that which is free from unnecessary fixations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is ok that we have anxious, fearful and other undesirable thoughts, because we do not actually choose to have them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is ok that we have anxious, fearful and other undesirable thoughts, because we do not actually choose to have them. Also the relative effect that each thought carries, such as good or bad; beautiful or ugly; noble or base, and so on; lose their meaning with the disappearance of that thought. At an absolute level, there is no meaning whatsoever to any thoughts.</p>

<p>When we can clearly see that all thoughts that arise are spontaneously liberated right there and then; every moment that we experience is totally new. There is never a recycled moment. The appearance of the old, the mundane, and, the fearful are only illusions created by our memories.</p>

<p>Realise the incontrollable and insignificant nature of all thoughts, and experience reality for what it truly is, from one moment to the next; always new, fresh, and never again to be experienced like-for-like.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Live a life where the past cannot stain the present, which is forever spontaneously manifesting into an unique existence at an infinitesimal rate. The big joke is that it is already like this; just that we have temporarily forgotten it</p>
