The writings of this blog records my journey into a purely joyful way of being, that does not waver regardless of what happens in my life. I would like to share some insights that has allowed me to be more spontaneous and playful with everything that life throws at me.

I have spent most of my life suffering with doubts and fears of all kinds, which I realise now to be totally unnecessary. The subtle message here is that what is unnecessary is the suffering. Doubt and fear are not the problem in themselves; they are a natural response of the human mind and body. It would be unnatural for someone to never doubt or fear. How could someone like that survive or get anything done? 

> Suffering is absolutely unnecessary

Suffering is absolutely unnecessary, and it is possible to live your life without it. What does life without suffering feel like? Purely joyful. This pure joy does not depend on any objects outside of oneself, or any thoughts inside of oneself. It is always available to anyone who does not get lost in one’s own mind. Actually everyone knows what it feels like already; it has simply been forgotten. All human beings were purely joyful before the brain began to store memories. Look into an infant’s innocent eyes that sees everything afresh, and you will get an inkling of what you have forgotten.

> Doubt and fear are not anything other than the brain responding to whatever circumstances that are encountered, to ensure the security and the safety of that human body

Of course, it would be silly to suggest that you go back into an infantile state. The brain must develop so that we can function in the world. The nature of the mind is to measure, define and store memories so that we can use them as a reference for survival. Doubt and fear are not anything other than the brain responding to whatever circumstances that are encountered, to ensure the security and the safety of that human body. 

> The end of suffering begins with recognising fear and doubt for what they are; simply a simulated response of the brain 

The end of suffering begins with recognising fear and doubt for what they are; simply a simulated response of the brain. How does it respond? From what we sense and perceive, the mind creates thoughts that simulate a particular reality. But this conceptual reality is not real! It is only an abstraction; formed of relative thoughts that secures and protects the sense of *I*. 

> Suffering ends when you see through that not a single thought has any authority over your actual reality

Suffering is not anything other than the conflict caused by the absolute belief in one’s own thoughts. To believe in anything is conflictive because what is abstract can never truly be compared to what is real. Suffering ends when you see through that not a single thought has any authority over your actual reality; that which cannot be understood conceptually. Reality simply *is*.

> With the understanding that not a single thought has to be taken seriously; fear and doubt may continue to arise but they are no longer significant

I am not denying the incredible functionality and creativity of thoughts. The human mind has created an entire universe out of concepts. What I am challenging is; why suffer when it is unnecessary? With the understanding that not a single thought has to be taken seriously; fear and doubt may continue to arise but they are no longer significant. 

> Everything becomes an inspiration because without the seriousness of thoughts, everything is always afresh and spontaneously arising

Unbound by thoughts, it is possible that your life may transform miraculously, where the ordinary becomes the extraordinary. This is the ground in which your purely joyful nature may begin to shine out. Everything becomes an inspiration because without the seriousness of thoughts, everything is always afresh and spontaneously arising. Pure joy is that spontaneous playfulness that originates from engaging with reality *as is*. Even fear and doubt become a kind of loving expression of what *is*.
